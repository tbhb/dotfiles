# Claude Code — Global Instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think before coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. For substantive ambiguity (architecture, API shape, correctness), ask. For stylistic or conventional ambiguity, pick, state the choice inline, and move on.
- If multiple interpretations exist and they'd produce meaningfully different code, present them. If the difference is cosmetic, pick one.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity first

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that can't arise given current call sites. If you add a handler for a hypothetical, justify it in a comment.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it. Don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-driven execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified, within reason.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**Bound the loop.** If verification fails three times with materially different approaches, stop. Report what you tried, what failed, and what you think the blocker is. Don't keep iterating on the same shape of fix.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## GitHub CLI

Use `gh query` instead of `gh api` for read-only GitHub API calls — it is automatically allowed without a confirmation prompt. `gh query` accepts the same arguments as `gh api` but blocks mutating methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and `--input`.

Use `gh api` (which requires confirmation) only when you actually need to mutate state.
